Vacuum was started soon after time point 5 

intensity of well 6 is 354.8 at t5

ran with vacuum only to see if the value remains steady

t6 = 340.272 decrease flow, initally at 30 on rotameter, now at ten. 30 was pulling water into flask rapidly ~20 mL/min. At 10 the there is about 1 drop per second.

t7 = 339.789
t8 = 339.219
t9 = 338.818 

It seems that the flow is causeing the intensity to decrease, most likely through cooling of the sensor. The rotameter is now set to below 5. 

t10 = 338.576
t11 = 338.494 

gas started after t11 - 5% CO2 bal. nitrogen

t12 = 667.168
t13 =
