The device is placed in the dish not weighted down

Vacuum was started soon after time point 5 

intensity of well 6 is 354.8 at t5

ran with vacuum only to see if the value remains steady

t6 = 340.272 decrease flow, initally at 30 on rotameter, now at ten. 30 was pulling water into flask rapidly ~20 mL/min. At 10 the there is about 1 drop per second.

t7 = 339.789

t8 = 339.219

t9 = 338.818 

It seems that the flow is causeing the intensity to decrease, most likely through cooling of the sensor. The rotameter is now set to below 5. 

t10 = 338.576

t11 = 338.494 

gas started after t11 - 5% CO2 bal. nitrogen

t12 = 667.168

t13 = 731.666

wells 1-5 appear to have no bubbles. 6 has a bubbles that grows during duration, although it seems to be out of the plane of focus, perhaps below the standing well insert or in the device? Perhaps there was a leak and water was pulled into the device? I dont see any water in the device, could have been evaporated as well.

data was logged in to a txt file starting with the exp, then dry calibration, then ss calibration.

New experiment
-----------

same procedure as 050714 

vacuum started after t5. Vacuum rotameter was not touched, it appears to be at the same reading, just under 5. 

well 6 t4 = 366.925

t5 = 365.572

t6 = 363.806

t7 = 362.583

t8 = 361.686

t9 = 361.068

t10 = 360.595

Gas line hooked up after t10 

050914

post calibration taken at 11am 

at 11:15 a aquasition of 30 sec intervals was started after pulling room air rather then %5 CO2 bal. N2. 

intensity data was analyzed and recorded in a txt file intensities050814 starting with SS calibraion, then exp, pulling air

the stage memorization is off. well 1 is 3, 3 was taken twice. 

New Experiment 050914
----
Same procedure as before

calibration was taken with SS then non SS water was replaced and the device placed in without vacuum for first 5 timepoints 

t3 = 374.297
t4 = 373.091
t5 = 371.942

vacuum turned on only pulling air

t6 = 369.925

t7 = 368.804

t8 = 367.961

t9 = 367.043

t10 = 366.204

5% CO2 gas line inserted in to vaccum inlet 

t11 = 700.153

intensities logged to .log txt file with SS calibrations first

no bubbles were seen in the images

060514
------
Data was analyzed for days trials 1, 3 and 4 (050714,050914,051214). The second trial was skipped because of the error in stage positions causeing one well to be imaged twice while missing one well. 

The averaged N=3 data looks good.
It is apparent that the distal well do not achieve as much flow or the pillers did not reach close enough to the sensors.
I may try weighing down the device in the plate.

Collecting oxygen data the 6 well device
Calibration preformed with SS and with 0% O2 flowing through the device (5% CO2, bal. N2). 
0% O2 gas flowing during calibration to account for temperature changes due to flow and to eliminate O2 difusion from the device to off set calibration point.
vacuum Rotameter: 8
flow rotameter: 27

took nearly 2 hrs for the intensity to stop increasing, calibration images taken and saved in sscal

Calibration for 21% oxygen is preformed after the plate and device are rinsed with DI water and dryed.
Fresh DI water is pipetted into the wells, and air from a compressed air tank is flowed throught the device with vacuum. The vacuum and flow rotameter are set to the same rates. 
intensity steadys around 20 min

z stage was very out of focus the next day. data may be not good

10 points were taken the next day whit z re focused.

I noticed that the weights were not enough to keep the device at the bottom of the wells. One side 1 or 6 side may have been 1mm away from the bottom.

091914
------

New experiment same procedure as 091914. Larger weights this time to keep the device in the bottom of the wells.

092514
------

Started new experiment. 

Noticed water in the tubing and device after calibration with SS. At least 2 pillar were leaking. the device was dehydrated on a hot plate and patched around the membranes with more PDMS. 

100114
------

Experiment with new full plate device.

Took more than an hour for the SS calibration intensity values to steady.
I wonder if the slow action of SS is due to it not being opened in a nitrogen environment.
after the fourth time point the tube was placed in the 5% CO2 bal. N2 tube.
