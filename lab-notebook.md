The device is placed in the dish not weighted down

Vacuum was started soon after time point 5 

intensity of well 6 is 354.8 at t5

ran with vacuum only to see if the value remains steady

t6 = 340.272 decrease flow, initally at 30 on rotameter, now at ten. 30 was pulling water into flask rapidly ~20 mL/min. At 10 the there is about 1 drop per second.

t7 = 339.789

t8 = 339.219

t9 = 338.818 

It seems that the flow is causeing the intensity to decrease, most likely through cooling of the sensor. The rotameter is now set to below 5. 

t10 = 338.576

t11 = 338.494 

gas started after t11 - 5% CO2 bal. nitrogen

t12 = 667.168

t13 = 731.666

wells 1-5 appear to have no bubbles. 6 has a bubbles that grows during duration, although it seems to be out of the plane of focus, perhaps below the standing well insert or in the device? Perhaps there was a leak and water was pulled into the device? I dont see any water in the device, could have been evaporated as well.

data was logged in to a txt file starting with the exp, then dry calibration, then ss calibration.

New experiment
-----------

same procedure as 050714 

vacuum started after t5. Vacuum rotameter was not touched, it appears to be at the same reading, just under 5. 

well 6 t4 = 366.925

t5 = 365.572

t6 = 363.806

t7 = 362.583

t8 = 361.686

t9 = 361.068

t10 = 360.595

Gas line hooked up after t10 

050914

post calibration taken at 11am 

at 11:15 a aquasition of 30 sec intervals was started after pulling room air rather then %5 CO2 bal. N2. 

intensity data was analyzed and recorded in a txt file intensities050814 starting with SS calibraion, then exp, pulling air

the stage memorization is off. well 1 is 3, 3 was taken twice. 

New Experiment 050914
----
Same procedure as before

calibration was taken with SS then non SS water was replaced and the device placed in without vacuum for first 5 timepoints 

t3 = 374.297
t4 = 373.091
t5 = 371.942

vacuum turned on only pulling air

t6 = 369.925

t7 = 368.804

t8 = 367.961

t9 = 367.043

t10 = 366.204

5% CO2 gas line inserted in to vaccum inlet 

t11 = 700.153

intensity data taken from 050914 place in a .log txt file with SS calibrations fist followed by exp

I dont see any bubbles forming in the images

raw images saved on patriot 

Expirment 051214
------
same procedure as previous days 

t1=373.719

t2=374.277

t3=374.711

t4=374.972

t5=374.874

vacuum turned on pulling room air

t6=372.992

t7=372.034

t8=

t9=371.33

t10=371.006

Gas tubing connceted 

051314
----

intensities logged to .log txt file with SS calibrations first

no bubbles were seen in the images

060514
------
Data was analyzed for days trials 1, 3 and 4 (050714,050914,051214). The second trial was skipped because of the error in stage positions causeing one well to be imaged twice while missing one well.
