rm The device is placed in the dish not weighted down

Vacuum was started soon after time point 5 

intensity of well 6 is 354.8 at t5

ran with vacuum only to see if the value remains steady

t6 = 340.272 decrease flow, initally at 30 on rotameter, now at ten. 30 was pulling water into flask rapidly ~20 mL/min. At 10 the there is about 1 drop per second.

t7 = 339.789

t8 = 339.219

t9 = 338.818 

It seems that the flow is causeing the intensity to decrease, most likely through cooling of the sensor. The rotameter is now set to below 5. 

t10 = 338.576

t11 = 338.494 

gas started after t11 - 5% CO2 bal. nitrogen

t12 = 667.168

t13 = 731.666

wells 1-5 appear to have no bubbles. 6 has a bubbles that grows during duration, although it seems to be out of the plane of focus, perhaps below the standing well insert or in the device? Perhaps there was a leak and water was pulled into the device? I dont see any water in the device. 

data was logged in to a txt file starting with the exp, then dry calibration, then ss calibration.

New experiment
-----------

same procedure as 050714 

vacuum started after t5. Vacuum rotameter was not touched, it appears to be at the same reading, just under 5. 

well 6 t4 = 366.925

t5 = 365.572

t6 = 363.806

t7 = 362.583

t8 = 361.686

t9 = 361.068

t10 = 360.595

Gas line hooked up after t10
