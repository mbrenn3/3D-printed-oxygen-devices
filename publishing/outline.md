plan
----
1. get some figures in - then comment out after checking
2. outline text, methods.
3. comment out petri dish device

Figure 2 Oxygen Characterization
-----------
* petri dish
  * timcourse to zero
  * linescan - postition data
* 24 well plate
  * timcourse of 24 wells
  * 4 independent conditions
