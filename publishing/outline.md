Discusstion
----------

Advantages over standard microfluidic device
uses a 24 well plate
	no clultureing within a micro-device
	standard protocols / imaging / plate readers can be used
	* read shawn's paper again

Advantages over previous 6 well design
	simplified fabrication
		no parelyne coating
		no pdms casting
		no pdms layering fab
	allows more complicated design without anymore fabrication
	reusable - replacable membranes
	shareing of design - drop shipping 

Future development


Intro
===
Planer lithography Vs 3D printing
other 3D printed device papers
no material for oxygen control

Figure 1 Devices
---------------------

* CAD render of 3d printed part + membrane + dish
* cad render of whole 24 well part
* photo of whole part
* schematic of distribution network
* render of distribution network

Results and Discussion
===

Figure 2 Oxygen Characterization
-----------
* petri dish
  * timcourse to zero
  * linescan - postition data
* 24 well plate
  * timcourse of 24 wells
  * 4 independent conditions

Figure 3 cell stuff with megan
----------
get figures
