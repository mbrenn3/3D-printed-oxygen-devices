plan
----
1. get some figures in - then comment out after checking
2. outline text, methods.
3. comment out petri dish device

Intro
===
Planer lithography Vs 3D printing
other 3D printed device papers
no material for oxygen control

Figure 1 Devices
---------------------

* cad render crosssection of 24 well plate
  * 3d printed part + membrane + dish
* cad render of whole 24 well part + photo
* schematic of distribution network

Results and Discussion
===

Figure 2 Oxygen Characterization
-----------
* petri dish
  * timcourse to zero
  * linescan - postition data
* 24 well plate
  * timcourse of 24 wells
  * 4 independent conditions

Figure 3 Bio-Verification
--------- 
what does the data look like?

Figure 4 cell stuff with megan
----------
get figures
