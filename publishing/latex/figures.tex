{\bf 24-well Insert Device.} A microfluidic network distributes gas flow from one hose barb input to 6 wells.
A 'Pipe with in a pipe' design delivers gas to the bottom of each well where it diffuses to the culture through an adhered PDMS membrane (blue-layer).  
The distribution network width of the channels in the distribution network are such that the flow rates are equalized to each well dependent on the path length.

{\bf Oxygen Characterization.}  Time course data of oxygen being evacuated from the culture area as 0\% oxygen gas is perfused through the device. Each 6 well row of the plate can be controlled independently.
