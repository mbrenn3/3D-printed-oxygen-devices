abstract = {The vast majority of microfluidic devices are developed in PDMS by molding ("soft lithography") because PDMS is an inexpensive material, has physicochemical properties that are well suited for biomedical and physical sciences applications, and design cycle lengths are generally adequate for prototype development. However, PDMS molding is tediously slow and thus cannot provide the high- or medium-volume production required for the commercialization of devices. While high-throughput plastic molding techniques (e.g. injection molding) exist, the exorbitant cost of the molds and/or the equipment can be a serious obstacle for device commercialization, especially for small startups. High-volume production is not required to reach niche markets such as clinical trials, biomedical research supplies, customized research equipment, and classroom projects. Crucially, both PDMS and plastic molding are layer-by-layer techniques where each layer is produced as a result of physicochemical processes not specified in the initial photomask(s) and where the final device requires assembly by bonding, all resulting in a cost that is very hard to predict at the start of the project. By contrast, stereolithography (SL) is an automated fabrication technique that allows for the production of quasi-arbitrary 3D shapes in a single polymeric material at medium-volume throughputs (ranging from a single part to hundreds of parts). Importantly, SL devices can be designed between several groups using CAD tools, conveniently ordered by mail, and their cost precisely predicted via a web interface. Here we evaluate the resolution of an SL mail-order service and the main causes of resolution loss; the optical clarity of the devices and how to address the lack of clarity for imaging in the channels; and the future role that SL could play in the commercialization of microfluidic devices.},

abstract = {We report two 3D printed devices that can be used for electrochemical detection. In both cases, the electrode is housed in commercially available, polymer-based fittings so that the various electrode materials (platinum, platinum black, carbon, gold, silver) can be easily added to a threaded receiving port printed on the device; this enables a module-like approach to the experimental design, where the electrodes are removable and can be easily repolished for reuse after exposure to biological samples. The first printed device represents a microfluidic platform with a 500 × 500 $\mu$m channel and a threaded receiving port to allow integration of either polyetheretherketone (PEEK) nut-encased glassy carbon or platinum black (Pt-black) electrodes for dopamine and nitric oxide (NO) detection, respectively. The embedded 1 mm glassy carbon electrode had a limit of detection (LOD) of 500 nM for dopamine and a linear response (R(2) = 0.99) for concentrations between 25-500 $\mu$M. When the glassy carbon electrode was coated with 0.05\% Nafion, significant exclusion of nitrite was observed when compared to signal obtained from equimolar injections of dopamine. When using flow injection analysis with a Pt/Pt-black electrode and standards derived from NO gas, a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.99) over a wide range of concentrations (7.6-190 $\mu$M) was obtained, with the LOD for NO being 1 $\mu$M. The second application showcases a 3D printed fluidic device that allows collection of the biologically relevant analyte adenosine triphosphate (ATP) while simultaneously measuring the release stimulus (reduced oxygen concentration). The hypoxic sample (4.8 ± 0.5 ppm oxygen) released 2.4 ± 0.4 times more ATP than the normoxic sample (8.4 ± 0.6 ppm oxygen). Importantly, the results reported here verify the reproducible and transferable nature of using 3D printing as a fabrication technique, as devices and electrodes were moved between labs multiple times during completion of the study.},

abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane is a translucent and biologically inert silicone material used in sealants, biomedical implants and microscale lab-on-a-chip devices. Furthermore, in membrane technology polydimethylsiloxane represents a material for separation barriers as it has high permeabilities for various gases. The facile handling of two component formulations with a silicone base material, a catalyst and a small molecular weight crosslinker make it widely applicable for soft-lithographic replication of two-dimensional device geometries, such as microfluidic chips or micro-contact stamps. Here we develop a new technique to directly print polydimethylsiloxane in a rapid prototyping device, circumventing the need for masks or sacrificial mold production. We create a three-dimensional polydimethylsiloxane membrane for gas-liquid-contacting based on a Schwarz-P triple-periodic minimal- surface, which is inaccessible with common machining techniques. Direct 3D-printing of polydimethylsiloxane enables the rapid production of novel chip geometries for a manifold of lab-on-a-chip applications.},

abstract = {3D printing techniques allow the laboratory-scale design and production of reactionware tailored to specific experimental requirements. To increase the range and versatility of reactionware devices, sealed, monolithic reactors suitable for use in hydrothermal synthesis have been digitally designed and realized. The fabrication process allows the introduction of reaction mixtures directly into the reactors during the production, and also enables the manufacture of devices of varying scales and geometries unavailable in traditional equipment. The utility of these devices is shown by the use of 3D printed, high-throughput array reactors to discover two new coordination polymers, optimize the synthesis of one of these, and scale-up its synthesis using larger reactors produced on the same 3D printer. Reactors were also used to produce phase-pure samples of coordination polymers MIL-96 and HKUST-1, in yields comparable to synthesis in traditional apparatus.},

abstract = {Cell migration is a hallmark of cancer cell metastasis and is highly correlated with hypoxia in tumors. The Boyden chamber is a porous membrane-based migration platform that has seen a great deal of use for both in vitro migration and invasion assays due to its adaptability to common culture vessels and relative ease of use. The hypoxic chamber is a current tool that can be implemented to investigate the cellular response to oxygen paradigms. Unfortunately, this method lacks the spatial and temporal precision to accurately model a number of physiological phenomena. In this article, we present a newly developed microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device that easily adapts to the Boyden chamber, and provides more control over the oxygenation conditions exposed to cells. The device equilibrates to 1\% oxygen in about 20 min, thus demonstrating the capabilities of a system for researchers to establish both short-term continuous and intermittent hypoxia regimes. A Parylene-C thin-film coating was used to prevent ambient air penetration through the bulk PDMS and was found to yield improved equilibration times and end-point concentrations. MDA-MD-231 cells, an invasive breast cancer line, were used as a model cell type to demonstrate the effect of oxygen concentration on cell migration through the Boyden chamber porous membrane. Continuous hypoxia downregulated migration of cells relative to the normoxic control, as did an intermittent hypoxia regime (IH) cycling between 0\% and 21\% oxygen (0-21\% IH). However, cells exposed to 5-21\% IH exhibited increased migration compared to the other conditions, as well as relative to the normoxic control. The results presented here show the device can be utilized for experiments implementing the Boyden chamber for in vitro hypoxic studies, allowing experiments to be conducted faster and with more precision than currently possible.},

abstract = {Oxygen is a key modulator of many cellular pathways, but current devices permitting in vitro oxygen modulation fail to meet the needs of biomedical research. A microfabricated insert for multiwell plates has been developed to more effectively control the temporal and spatial oxygen concentration to better model physiological phenomena found in vivo. The platform consists of a polydimethylsiloxane insert that nests into a standard multiwell plate and serves as a passive microfluidic gas network with a gas-permeable membrane aimed to modulate oxygen delivery to adherent cells. Equilibration time is on the order of minutes and a wide variety of oxygen profiles can be attained based on the device design, such as the cyclic profile achieved in this study, and even oxygen gradients to mimic those found in vivo. The proper biological consequences of the device's oxygen delivery were confirmed in cellular models via a proliferation assay and western analysis of the upregulation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1alpha. These experiments serve as a demonstration for the platform as a viable tool to increase experimental throughput and permit novel experimental possibilities in any biomedical research lab.},

abstract = {One-step fabrication of transparent three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic to millifluidic devices was demonstrated using a commercial 3D printer costing \$2300 with 500 mL of clear resin for \$138. It employs dynamic mask projection stereolithography, allowing fast concept-to-chip time. The fully automated system allows fabrication of models of up to 43 mm × 27 mm × 180 mm (x × y × z) at printing speeds of 20 mm/h in height regardless of the design complexity. The minimal cross sectional area of 250 $\mu$m was achieved for monolithic microchannels and 200 $\mu$m for positive structures (templates for soft lithography). The colorless resin's good light transmittance (>60\% transmission at wavelengths of >430 nm) allows for on-chip optical detection, while the electrically insulating material allows electrophoretic separations. To demonstrate its applicability in microfluidics, the printer was used for the fabrication of a micromixer, a gradient generator, a droplet extractor, and a device for isotachophoresis. The mixing and gradient formation units were incorporated into a device for analysis of nitrate in tap water with standard addition as a single run and multiple depth detection cells to provide an extended linear range.},

This approach yields a pervasive network of smooth cylindrical channels (approximately 10-300 microm) with defined connectivity. Square-spiral towers, isolated within this vascular network, promote fluid mixing through chaotic advection. These vertical towers give rise to dramatic improvements in mixing relative to simple straight (1D) and square-wave (2D) channels while significantly reducing the device planar footprint. We envisage that 3D microvascular networks will provide an enabling platform for a wide array of fluidic-based applications.},
