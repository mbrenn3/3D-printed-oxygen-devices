\section*{Abstract}

Recently 3D printing has emerged as a method for directly printing complete microfluidic chips, 
although printing materials have been limited to non-oxygen permeable materials.
We demonstrate the addition of gas permeable PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) membranes to 3D printed microfluidic devices as a means to enable oxygen control cell culture studies.
%Two devices are presented and characterized.

\section*{Introduction}

3D printing of microfluidic devices enables rapid, one-step fabrication of complex designs infeasible to make with planar lithography and replica molding techniques.
In addition, planar lithography is time consuming, requires specialized equipment and facilities, and has a high failure rate.
It is not unusual for labs to make ten microfluidic devices to guarnantee one will work properly.
On the other hand, 3D CAD printing allows for unambiguous specifications and nearly eliminates time and effort spent on fabrication which is outsourced to a 3D printing company for around \$100/device \cite{Au2014,Chen2014}.
3D printing also allows integration of complex geometeries not possible with planar lithograpy, such as hose barbs and leur fittings.
Dissemination and distributed production is also vastly simplified due to easy shareing the design as a CAD file.
Due to these inherent advantages 3D printing has emerged as a method for directly printing complete microfluidic devices \cite{Au2014, Chen2014} (Poland guy?, UK guy?) 
Printing is currently limited in choice of materials when compared to MEMS style fabrication. 
As of yet there is no widely available methods or materials to facilitate direct printing of gas permeable materials.

Microfluidic cell culture devices are often made out of PDMS via soft photo lithography.
PDMS is a convient material for cell studies due to it's biocompatability, optical properties, and gas periability, faciliataing oxygen control of cell environments.

Oxygen control in cells studies is often overlooked by researchers, but important for mimicing conditions expericend by cells in vivo.
Typically cell culture studies are preformed at 21\% oxygen, atmospheric oxygen conditions, although levels that cells experience in vivo are usually less.
For example tumors, in gereral, are hypoxic as they rapidly out grow their vasculature creating a hypoxic inner region. 
To better study the role of oxygen levels in cancer gene expression a gas controled culture system is required.

Oxygen control mulitwell inserts have been previously developed, which were cast entirely from PDMS, for 6 well culture plates. \cite{Oppegard2009, Oppegard2010}.
To replicate the 6-well design for a 24 well format the fabriation via PDMS casting becomes too tedious and to be done by hand and has a high failure rate.
Utilizing 3D printing for the fabrication allowed futher features to be incoporated such as integrated distubtion channels and hose barbs, while elminating fabrication time and failure rate.
Although avalible 3D pritable materials are non-gas-permiable, the addition of a PDMS membrane allows gas transfer. 
In this case, having a non-gas-permaible material for the bulk is advantagous as it acts as a insulator to gas transfer. 
Convection and distribution of the gas is done in the non-permiable material eliminating dilution of the gas before reaching the diffusion layer. 
The previous PDMS devices were paralene coated along the convection channels to eliminate exchange of gas from the PDMS bulk. 

\bf{Motovation for oxygen control, what we have done previously in oxygen and sepcificly the 6-well plate and why we need to do this with a 3D printer. Also a bit on negative pressure Vs. positive pressure. - I don't have any data or any reason that I can prove for doing this. I was orginally afraid that the membranes would come off from the pressure, I am testing it now.

Here we report on the development of 3D printed microfluidic devices for the control of oxygen in cell culture microenvironments.
We demonstrate a device that nests into a 24 well culture plate to control gas in each row of the plate independently of the incubators's condition.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

%The 3-inch (75 mm) petri dish device contains a 500 $\mu$m wide channel following a serpentine path leaving 500 $\mu$m of spacing between channels and has integrated hose barbs directly printed onto the device.
%The 3D part is printed with the channels embedded in the bottom of the petri dish. 
%A 120 $\mu$m thick PDMS membrane is adhered across the channels by spin coating a thin layer of PDMS on the membrane and allowing it to cure in place.
%The device is designed so that a standard 3” petri dish lid may be used.
%This device allows cell culture in a large open well format compatible with assays requiring cell scraping.
%The membrane is easily peeled away allowing additional fixing/staining assays to be preformed and can also be replaced with a new membrane to reuse the device. 

\subsection*{Design of Insert}

The device was designed to integrate with a multiwell format, specifically an off-the-shelf 24 well plate. 
The 24 well plate insert is designed to control gas in 6 wells of a 24 well culture plate from one input, borrowing the working principle of previous work\cite{oppegard2010} and also incorporates an integrated distribution network and hose barbs to simplify device operation.
The pillars extend into each well leaving a $\sim$500 $\mu$m gap for media between the diffusion membrane and the culture surface at the bottom of the well.
Diffusion occurs rapidly across this gap allowing control of the dissolved gas environment around the cells. 
A distribution network stems from the central input that equalizes the flow along each path length by varying the channel width to the proximal, intermediate, and distal wells (Figure \ref{figure1}.

The device also features a ‘pipe within a pipe’ design so that gas flow enters and leaves the diffusion area in a uniform, and symmetrical flow pattern, which would not be possible with standard lithography and demonstrates the capabilities of 3D printing (Figure \ref{figure1}.
Again the membranes are adhered with a thin layer of PDMS on the membrane and allowed to cure in place.

The device was printed by Fineline Prototyping in Watershed XC using stereolithography.
CAD models were designed and printed with microfluidic delivery channels, and then completed by 
adhering a gas permeable membrane of PDMS to enable diffusion of gas to the culture area. 

\subsection*{Oxygen characterization}

Oxygen was measured with PtOEPK (Pt(II) Octaethylporphine ketone) planar sensors that were fixed to the bottom of a 24 well plate. 
The intensity of the sensor was measured and correlated to the concentration of oxygen with Stern-Volmer analysis (Figure \ref{piller-well-render-figure}.
Gas was perfused through the device with negative pressure to eliminate bubbles.
The inlet tubing was placed in a cone with with a flow that exceed the vacuum flow rate so that the vacuum was always pulling in the gas of interest and not the room air.
All gas tanks used in the oxygen characterization were 5\% CO2 in addition to the desired gas mix in anticipation of cell culture experiments as CO2 can alter the fluorescence of the PtOEPK.

\section*{Results and Discussion}

%Oxygen was measured in the 3” petri dish device with a commercial fiber­optic probe (Figure 2).
%Oxygen control was demonstrated with gas flowing through the channel under the PDMS membrane.

The 24 well insert device was quantified with a platinum based (PtOEPK) planar oxygen sensor as shown in Figure \ref{oxygen-char-figure}.
Oxygen control was able to be controlled in each of the 6 wells equally from one gas input demonstrating the distribution network.
The device reaches steady state in 30 minutes and can then hold the oxygen level near 0\% indefinitely, while 100\% nitrogen is pumped through the device.

\section*{Conclusion}
3D printing microfluidic chips have been limited to non oxygen permeable materials.
We demonstrate oxygen control in 3D printed devices the addition of a gas permeable PDMS membrane. 
Oxygen control is demonstrated in a open well petri dish design and a 24 well plate.
3D printing allows complex designs, integrated tubing connectors, and is comparable in price to standard PDMS fabrication.
This technique represents a bridge to commercialization where robust devices can be more easily shared and disseminated.
While injection molding, hot embossing, or other industrial processes are cheaper when making hundreds to thousands of devices, it is not practical to make a injection mold when making tens to hundreds of devices.
In addition, PDMS fabrication would be too time consuming, expensive, and the failure rate would be unacceptable.
3D printing is a perfect solution to these device fabrication needs.
