This folder contains all the documentation, protocols, data, and manuscript for the 3D printed oxygen devices. 

This will be my first attempt at git tracking a master folder with all the files in one folder.

- [ ] make a github pages for project to coincide with publication
- [ ] check plos one format and latex outline

todo
====
- [ ] analyze data with imageJ

- [ ] make plos template seprate from images
- [ ] run bubble test
- [ ] make network figure
- [ ] well-render with labels and scale bar
- [ ] network render with labels and scale bar
- [ ] get megan to write pcr methods, and ask about discussion
- [ ] write section about shawn's device, and dificulties going to 24 well format.
-

--------------

- [ ] add column for x values, time points or minutes to percents
- [ ] add row labels to percents
- [ ] make file run with arguments to point to the file to analyze 

- [ ] make a publication plan document

- [ ] find old data that shows the formation of bubbles

Publication outline

Main Goal: demonstrate oxygen control with devices
	mention vacuum flow Vs pressure flow for bubbles

Figure 1: 3D rendering and images of devices
* 3D rendering in Blender
* 24 well device in plate
* petri dish device with lid
* close up membranes
* close up of barbs

Figure 2: Distribution network
* overhead schematic of network
* rendering of overlay and pipe in pipe design 


Figure 3: Oxygen data
24 well device:
* time course data from 21 to 0
* time course data from 0 to 5 to 10 to 21
* final values reached

petri dish: 
* time course from 21 to 0
* time course from 0 to 5 to 10 to 21
* line scan across walls
* difference between the beginning and end of channel

Figure 4: oxygenation schemes with 24 well plate
* data of each row with different oxygen level

Figure 5? bubbles formation?
