This folder contains all the documentation, protocols, data, and manuscript for the 3D printed oxygen devices. 

This will be my first attempt at git tracking a master folder with all the files in one folder.

- [ ] make a github pages for project to coincide with publication
- [ ] check plos one format and latex outline

todo
====
- [ ] analyze data with imageJ

- [ ] run bubble test

- [ ] well-render with labels and scale bar

- [ ] get megan to write pcr methods, and ask about discussion

- [ ] start new plos template: http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/01/streamlined-formatting-plos-article/

quick plan
--------------

spell check

pandoc for dte

--------
fugutive inks cite
sources for oxygen in intro
fix chemical formating CO2

- [ ] find old data that shows the formation of bubbles

Publication outline

Main Goal: demonstrate oxygen control with devices
	mention vacuum flow Vs pressure flow for bubbles

Figure 1: 3D rendering and images of devices
* 3D rendering in Blender
* 24 well device in plate
* petri dish device with lid
* close up membranes
* close up of barbs

Figure 2: Distribution network
* overhead schematic of network
* rendering of overlay and pipe in pipe design 


Figure 3: Oxygen data
24 well device:
* time course data from 21 to 0
* time course data from 0 to 5 to 10 to 21
* final values reached

petri dish: 
* time course from 21 to 0
* time course from 0 to 5 to 10 to 21
* line scan across walls
* difference between the beginning and end of channel

Figure 4: oxygenation schemes with 24 well plate
* data of each row with different oxygen level

Figure 5? bubbles formation?
