1. prepare water reservoirs - DI water to equilibrate over night, place in scope room 

2. run vacuum tubing from aspirator to scope room

3. write procedure


Procedure
---------

1. Immobilized the plate on the stage with removable shims. Set up memorize positions on the scope for the 6 wells. Set up Multi-dimensional data acquisition and take a series of measurements as a reference and to confirm that everything is working.  

2. Add sodium sulfite (SS) to equilibrated water at 2 g/L, gently mix.

3. Add water to 6 wells starting with 'elbowed syringe' to fill from under the standing insert so as not to trap air between the insert membrane and the well bottom.  

4. Do calibration measurements after re-focusing of the memorized positions. 10 acquisitions per well

5. Take the 24 well plate off the stage and rinse it with DI water to remove all SS treated water.

6. Place the plate back on the stage and fill as before in step 3, with non SS treated equilibrated water. Re-focus the stage positions and take calibration measurements. 10 acquisitions per well

7. Start time course experiment of 145 acquisitions 5 min apart. Begin the vacuum and turn on 5% CO2 bal. N2 after time-point 5.
