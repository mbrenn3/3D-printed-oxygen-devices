Analyze data
	decide what timepoints to use for calibration
	figure out what happened on day two - check if the double points are useful - also check pulling room air
	extend sci-davis ploting to full time points 

get together some publication plan to show DTE with the data
	make another full sized 24 well?, 6 well, 48 well, 96 well?

decide if calibration is OK with change while pulling room air. 

put CAD designs in git 

get .bib file going, look into storage for larger files out of git/git hub? 

compare intensity analysis with image J 

decide how publish readme to be quick overview

###compare pressureized flow to vacuum flow in the formation of bubbles
Do pressure expirments to demonstrate bubble formation or find old data that showes bubble formation

Poster for CCNE?

papers: folch, other two
