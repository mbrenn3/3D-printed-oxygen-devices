Plan for experiments

compare pressureized flow to vacuum flow in the formation of bubbles

I know bubbles will form
* perhaps just look at old data

Do I have two of the same rotameters? I need one vacuum and one for flow

source/prepare
------

equilibrated water 


Goal
---
Characterize oxygen control in both devices

*test/demonstrate that pulling gas through eliminates bubble formation or dehydration of culture area
